# CoalitionFormationInGames

Shape formation for a group of agents is crucial in many strategy games as it brings collective payoff through cooperation. Finding a good formation for a group of agents in games is considered as a combinatorial optimization problem in this paper. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel and simple evolutionary algorithm based on a probability learning matrix, which is the foundation of a formation learning and discovery mechanism. Experimental results on several test problems show that the proposed algorithm works well in
comparison with another peer algorithm.
